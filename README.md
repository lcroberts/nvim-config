# Neovim Config

This neovim configuration started from kickstart.nvim. I originally used nvchad, however I wanted to understand the entire config so I remade it. I did take some convenient stuff from the nvchad source code though. One example of this is the `MasonInstallAll` command on the mason initialization and the gitsign symbols of choice. For everything to work properly you'll want the following packages installed:

`lldb, glow`
